## Project Overview

Automated Job Finder, or Auto Job (The Project) is a non-profit initiative that thrives to use simple technology to make big impact. Statistics shows that public servants change positions every 18 month, and sample survey confirms public servants take manual position search on weekly basis. Starting with serving public servants, the Project aims to replace such manual search with a customised weekly report on the most recent job market. Unlike Seek/Indeed, the Project will provide much more specific customisation including position classification, department, security clearance requirement, etc.

Apart from directly serving individuals, the Project seeks to collaborate with jurisdictions and universities to establish smart connection between university students and government job markets. Although the initial scope is mostly on public servant positions, the Project will scale to the general job market and bring benefit to the whole Australian labour force.
